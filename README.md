Bingusland USA is a ever-continuing project of mine, and it's reallly simple, its a open-source website 
originally made in late 2022 under neocities, then in late 2023 in nekoweb, and new here we are at Github.
even though bingusland was made for bypassing school web-blockers, it failed miserably at it due to neocities being blocked.
Bingusland usa is now just a fun project and i add games to it for fun

(btw i never took down the old sites, the neocities and nekoweb sites are still there)
